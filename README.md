# neovim-finder

This is an experimental Raycast extension that tries to integrate Raycast with
neovim. At the moment this is simply a side project, which mostly suits my needs, and
has no ambition to be a widely-usable extension. I am mostly developing based on my
needs, and to learn a bit coding with Raycast.
