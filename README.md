# neovim-finder

This is an experimental [Raycast](http://raycast.com/) extension that provides some useful commands to integrate Raycast with [neovim](https://neovim.io). 

At the moment this is simply a side project, which mostly suits my needs, and has no ambition to be a widely-usable extension. I am mostly developing based on my needs, and to learn a bit coding with Raycast. I am very interested in feedback, of course.

At present the extension relies on [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) and it has just 2 commands:

* Finder â†’ Neovim: opens a Finder folder (or file) in neovim. This extension is similar in spirit to the [Finder Terminal](https://www.raycast.com/yedongze/terminalfinder) extension, but it goes one step further by invoking iTerm2 and opening a neovim instance within it.

* Neovim Note: opens a note file with neovim or, if a note file is already open in neovim, it puts iTerm2 window in focus. At the moment the folder and naming conventions of the note file are hardwired in the code. I would like to let the users specify a folder and a filename, eventually.
